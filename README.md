# UFC-Fighter-Predictor

Welcome to the **UFC Fighter Comparer and Stat Tracker**! This project enables you to compare two UFC fighters based on their statistics and predict the likely winner using either a manual comparison or a machine learning model.

## Project Overview

The **UFC Fighter Comparer and Stat Tracker** provides two methods for predicting fight outcomes:

1. **Manual Comparison**: Compare specific metrics between two fighters to predict the winner.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Use a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict the winner based on historical fight statistics.

The project leverages a dataset of aggregated UFC fighter statistics to perform these comparisons and predictions.

## Features

- **Metric-Based Comparison**: Compare fighters using key statistics like significant strike ratio, takedown percentage, and more.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Uses a trained Random Forest model to predict the winner based on selected metrics.
- **Interactive Console**: A menu-driven interface allows you to choose the prediction method and input fighter information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**
